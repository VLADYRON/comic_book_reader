# todo:
* Fix issues with touch on Windows Surface Pro 3 (Chrome, and IE)
* Remove old pages from the cache, instead of loading all pages into ram eventually
* Page (x of x) is too hard to read, and in the way
* having the pages 100% width is good for a tablet, but not a desktop
* Remove old pages from the cache, instead of loading all pages into ram eventually
* we need a way to flip through all pages quickly and get a preview of them
* rar support
* manga (left to right) support
* remember previous page number when reloading files
* loading files from Drop Box, Google Drive, et cetera
* automatically identify comics using "perceptual image hashing"
